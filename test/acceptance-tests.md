* Ability to use square roots <y>
[additional-requriements]
* When sin/cos/tan is pressed, display sin/cos/tan to the display and then fill
* When asin/acos/atan is pressed, display sin/cos/tan to the display and then fill
[current-errors]
* When sin/cos/tan and asin/acos/atan is input and then cleared the following inputs are appended to the 0 that is replaced in the display
* x√y does not function: Invalid double error thrown
